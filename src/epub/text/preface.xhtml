			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface</h2>
			<p>The following poems were written originally for the amusement of the author, as they were the products of her leisure moments. She had no intention ever to have published them; nor would they now have made their appearance, but at the importunity of many of her best, and most generous friends; to whom she considers herself, as under the greatest obligations.</p>
			<p>As her attempts in poetry are now sent into the world, it is hoped the critic will not severely censure their defects; and we presume they have too much merit to be cast aside with contempt, as worthless and trifling effusions.</p>
			<p>As to the disadvantages she has laboured under, with regard to learning, nothing needs to be offered, as her masterâ€™s letter in the following page will sufficiently show the difficulties in this respect she had to encounter.</p>
			<p>With all their imperfections, the poems are now humbly submitted to the perusal of the public.</p>
