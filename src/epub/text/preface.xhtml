			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface</h2>
			<p>The following Poems were written originally for the Amusement of the Author, as they were the Products of her leisure Moments. She had no Intention ever to have published them; nor would they now have made their Appearance, but at the Importunity of many of her best, and most generous Friends; to whom she considers herself, as under the greatest Obligations.</p>
			<p>As her Attempts in Poetry are now sent into the World, it is hoped the Critic will not severely censure their Defects; and we presume they have too much Merit to be cast aside with Contempt, as worthless and trifling Effusions.</p>
			<p>As to the Disadvantages she has laboured under, with Regard to Learning, nothing needs to be offered, as her Masterâ€™s Letter in the following Page will sufficiently show the Difficulties in this Respect she had to encounter.</p>
			<p>With all their Imperfections, the Poems are now humbly submitted to the Perusal of the Public.</p>
